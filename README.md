# 20 DAYS OF CODE CHALLENGE
*The goal is to build one small project every single day for 20 days consecutively.*

I've commit to this challenge to force my way out of the tutorial hell :imp:

### WHY ?
At the end I'll anounce and start **freelancing** :fire::fire::fire:

### WHAT ?
Those projects are mainly **HTML & CSS** *(sometimes a bit of vanilla JS)* snippets.

### CONCLUSION
It helped me realise that I can already build amazing websites in a short amount of time. But I can also learn new thing quickly.
Try it and boost your confidence to undertake next level project :muscle:
